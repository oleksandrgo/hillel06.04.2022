	<h3>History</h3>
	<div id="text">Dudley Marjoribanks, the first Lord of Tweedmouth, developed golden retrievers in the mid-to-late 1800s. Although at one time a rumor indicated that golden retrievers descended from Russian sheep dogs, they were, in fact, bred in the Scottish Highlands. Marjoribanks bred the dogs for more than 50 years to create an ideal gundog—he was an avid hunter of waterfowl. Tweedmouth wanted a dog suited to the rainy climate and rugged terrain of the area, so he crossed his "yellow retriever" with a breed that is now extinct, the Tweed water spaniel. He also wanted the dog to be even-tempered in the home. 

A golden retriever was first shown at the British dog show in 1908. The Kennel Club in England officially recognized the golden retriever as a distinct breed in 1911. At that time, they were classified as "retriever — yellow or golden." In 1920, the breed name was officially changed to golden retriever. The breed came to the United Stats, via Canada, around 1910 and was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1932.</div>
