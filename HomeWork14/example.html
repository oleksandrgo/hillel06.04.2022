  <p><h3>Biography, creativity</h3>

<h4>Jack Vettriano (Hoggan) was born in 1951 in Metil, Scotland. At the age of 16, he left school and became an apprentice engineer at one of the mines near his hometown. For a long time he painted "on the table", not perceiving his hobby as something serious. At the same time, he often visited museums and art galleries and created copies of the paintings located there (mostly Impressionist paintings), telling others that this was just his hobby. When Jack Hoggan was 21 years old, a friend gave him watercolors and, in his own words, at that moment he decided to start purposefully honing his technique. However, the artist first presented his paintings to the public for the first time only in 1984 at the Shell art exhibition and after that he did not participate in any art events for several more years. In 1987, Jack Hoggan's wife Gale left him, and in 1989, when he was already 37 years old, the public first drew attention to Jack's work. It happened at the exhibition, which was organized annually by the Scottish Royal Academy and the artist's debut turned out to be enchanting - he presented two paintings and both of them were bought on the first day. In addition, he received a number of commissions for the creation of works in the future.

Perhaps in connection with the beginning of a serious career as an artist, or because of changes in his personal life, Hoggan soon moved to Edinburgh and took on the pseudonym Jack Vettriano (the changed name of the artist's mother). Immediately after moving, he applied to the University of Edinburgh for a degree in Visual Arts, but his application was rejected.

In the 90s, both in the UK and abroad, the name of Jack Vettriano became more and more famous. His solo exhibitions are held in Edinburgh, London, Hong Kong and Johannesburg. In November 1999, as part of the 20th Century Arts Fair, Vettriano's work was shown for the first time in New York. The artist presented 20 of his paintings to the public and all of them were sold on the opening night. I must say that this event aroused interest in the UK and more than 40 collectors from England and Scotland flew to the US to attend this event.

Jack Vettriano has studios in Scotland and London. Between 1993 and 2007, the interests of the artist were represented by the Portland Gallery (London) and in various exhibition announcements, etc. in the list of buyers of the artist's works, one could see the names of Jack Nicholson, Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Tim Rice and Robbie Coltrane.

In 2003, Jack Vettriano was awarded the Order of the British Empire by Elizabeth II. In 2004, Vettriano's painting "The Singing Butler", which was written back in 1992, set two records at once in his native country. Sold at auction for Â£744,800, the artist's work was both the most expensive painting ever sold in Scotland and the most expensive painting by a Scottish painter. It is curious that the images of people in this picture are copied by the author from the reference manual of the illustrator in 1987 (Eng. The Illustrator's Figure Reference Manual, 1987).</h4></p>
